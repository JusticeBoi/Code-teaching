INTRODUCTION
This is a demo for timing routine for C and Fortran.

It should run on any Linux X86 system. The X86 dependency is due to the usage
of the RDTSC instruction. The simple version based on clock_gettime should run
on any processor architecture.

The simple variant is based on calling clock_gettime while the advanced version
is a C module for measuring cycle counts based on the RDTSC instruction.

There is a C example showing the simple and advanced timing routines and a F90
example linking against the simple timing routine.

BUILD
The Makefile uses the Intel compiler as default and expects icc and ifort in your PATH.
You can adopt include_ICC.mk or add another one if you want to use another
compiler.  Which include file is used is specified by setting the TAG variable
at the top of the Makefile.

RUNNING
Just call timing-ICC :-). The demos call sleep(3) and display the measured time.
